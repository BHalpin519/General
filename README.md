Video game #1 - Geopolitics

These are the files for my first hobby video game, a 2D geopolitics game.
The original title was "Burgermeister," but the current name is "Burning Empires"

The game is meant to randomly generate a map with unique nation-states, city-states, etc. Gameplay can include civilian issues such as taxes, religion, social issues, economic policies, etc., as well as wars conflicts between nations

At the moment, I am unable to divide the nation into different nations. This is the main roadblock for the rest of the game; once this problem is solved I should be able to implement the other functions
